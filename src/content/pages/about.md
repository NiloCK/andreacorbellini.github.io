I’m a software developer with a passion for the web and the cloud. Over
the years, I’ve had the opportunity to work with a large set of
technologies, in many different fields. This has let me gain a wide and
deep experience. Nowadays, I enjoy designing cloud and cloud-based
services with focus on security, quality, scalability and continuous
delivery.

I like delivering high quality software in time. I also enjoy improving
and discussing development methodologies and I’m a fan of Agile
(although I do not see it as a set of unbreakable rules, but rather as
the formalization of a culture based on solid principles).

I like challenges and always try to experiment new technologies and
approaches to problems.

When I’m not working, I’m usually some feet underwater.
