I'm a software developer, currently living in Dublin and working for AWS.
I'm passionate about:

* Cloud computing: my dream is to build an autonomous, self-healing cloud.
* Information security: cryptography, authentication, validation. I think that
  building walls is more important than following conventions.
* Pure mathematics: in these days I'm particularly focused on algebraic
  topology, category theory and complex analysis.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually some feet underwater. The watery picture above
from the beautiful [Lake Garda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Garda), in
Italy, where I did hundreds of dives.
