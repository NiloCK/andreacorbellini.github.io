I'm a software developer with a passion for the web and the cloud. I like
exploring new things. Over the years, I've had the luck to play with many
languages (C, C++, Python, Java, Bash, Zsh, C# and lots more), many platforms
(Linux, FreeBSD and OpenSolaris are the ones I enjoyed the most), many
frameworks and other technologies. Nowadays my favorite toys are Python, C,
Docker and Ethereum.

When I'm not coding, I'm usually some feet underwater. The watery picture above
from the beautiful [Lake Garda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Garda),
where I did hunderds of dives.
